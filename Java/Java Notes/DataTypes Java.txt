Q3.Make a program that prints the table of a number that is input by the user. 
(HINT - You will have to write 10 lines for this but as we proceed in the course you will be studying about ‘LOOPS’ that will simplify your work A LOT!)

	1 : + (Addition) a + b
	2 : - (Subtraction) a - b
	3 : * (Multiplication) a * b
	4 : / (Division) a / b
	5 : % (Modulo or remainder) a % b
	Calculate the result according to the operation given and display it to the user.
